# Trip Corrections

Design notes and open questions for post-trip edits such as `NOTES ...` and a possible future `CORRECT ...` command.

## Why This Exists

Editing a trip after it ends is not just a UI concern. A corrected trip may already have been used for:

- prediction grading
- journey linking
- NetworkEngine observation
- TransferEngine-derived learning
- HabitEngine rebuild inputs
- training/export analysis

That means a post-hoc correction can make some derived data stale even if the trip document itself is now right.

## Current Practical Rule

For now, the simplest safe model is:

- trips process immediately at `END`
- low-risk edits like `notes` are fine
- high-impact edits mark the trip as corrected/stale rather than trying to fully unwind every downstream effect

Current high-impact fields:

- `route`
- `direction`
- `agency`
- `startStop`
- `startStopCode`
- `startStopName`
- `endStop`
- `endStopCode`
- `endStopName`

Current correction metadata / guardrails:

- `correctedAt`
- `correctedFields`
- `correctionSource`
- `originalValues` for changed fields when available
- `needs_reprocess`
- `exclude_from_accuracy`
- `exclude_from_training`

Background finalization (via `onTripFinalized` trigger + `runPostEndFinalization`) only runs on first `endTime`. Corrections set the exclusion flags and are skipped by the idempotency guard even if `needs_reprocess` is true; only explicit `triggerManualFinalization` (force) re-runs learning/grading.

## Recording User Intent in Corrections

When correcting a trip, prefer recording **what the user actually meant to enter** over immediately forcing the fully normalized canonical name.

### Why
- Future models (especially V6) benefit from seeing realistic imperfect inputs + the context (route, direction, time, etc.) that should have resolved them.
- It forces the matching logic to get stronger at handling real user phrasing instead of relying on perfect data.
- It creates better training signal about common failure modes.

### Practical Pattern
For a high-impact stop name correction (e.g. fixing a typo like "collegea"), follow this explicit checklist:

1. **Raw user input**  
   - `startStop` → Set to exactly what the user meant to text (e.g. `"College"`).  
   - Do **not** skip this even if `startStopName` will hold the canonical form.

2. **Canonical / Normalized name**  
   - `startStopName` → Set (or leave) as the correct canonical name from the stops library (e.g. `"College St at Spadina Ave"`).

3. **Matching flag**  
   - `stop_matched` → Set to `true` once the corrected raw intent + route/direction/time context should allow the system to resolve cleanly to the canonical stop.

4. **Correction metadata** (always required for high-impact changes)  
   - `correctedFields` → Use `ArrayUnion` to add the changed fields (e.g. `["startStop", "startStopName"]`).  
   - `correctedAt` → Set to the current timestamp.  
   - `originalValues` → Record the previous bad values for the fields being corrected (e.g. `{ "startStopName": "Collegea", "startStop": "collegea" }`).

5. **Exclusion / Reprocessing flags** (for high-impact corrections)  
   - `needs_reprocess` → `true`  
   - `exclude_from_training` → `true`  
   - `exclude_from_accuracy` → `true`

6. **Do not touch** (unless also intentionally correcting them)  
   - `journeyId`, `endStop*` fields, `route`, `direction`, etc.

**Example (real trip, May 2026, 506 Westbound):**

Before correction:
- `startStop`: null
- `startStopName`: "Collegea"
- `stop_matched`: false
- No correction metadata

After correction:
- `startStop`: "College" (what the user meant to text)
- `startStopName`: "College St at Spadina Ave" (canonical)
- `stop_matched`: true
- `correctedFields`: ["startStop", "startStopName"]
- `correctedAt`: <timestamp>
- `originalValues`: { "startStopName": "Collegea", "startStop": "collegea" }
- `needs_reprocess`: true
- `exclude_from_training`: true
- `exclude_from_accuracy`: true

This approach records the user's actual intent while still giving the trip a proper canonical name and protecting training/accuracy data.

The same pattern applies to other high-impact fields (route, direction, agency, etc.): record the intended raw/corrected value, ensure the canonical form is correct, set `stop_matched` / equivalent where applicable, apply full metadata + exclusion flags.

### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Stop name typo on a transfer-heavy route**  
User rode the 506 Westbound and typed "collegea" instead of "College".  
- Set `startStop = "College"`.  
- Set `startStopName = "College St at Spadina Ave"` (canonical).  
- Set `stop_matched = true` (route + direction context supports clean resolution).  
- `correctedFields`, `originalValues`, `correctedAt`, and all three exclusion flags (`needs_reprocess`, `exclude_from_training`, `exclude_from_accuracy`) are applied.  
Result: The trip records the user's actual intent while remaining properly matched and excluded from training/accuracy.

**Scenario 2: Route mistyped (high-impact route correction)**  
User meant to log a trip on the 510 but typed "51".  
- Set `route = "510"`.  
- `correctedFields` includes "route".  
- `originalValues.route = "51"`.  
- Apply full exclusion flags.  
- No `stop_matched` change unless the stop was also affected.  
This prevents the bad route from polluting NetworkEngine observations and training data.

**Scenario 3: Ambiguous input with low confidence**  
User typed a vague stop name on a complex corridor. Even after correction to the intended text, route + direction context is not strong enough for automatic matching.  
- Record the intended raw value in `startStop`.  
- Set the best available `startStopName`.  
- Leave `stop_matched = false`.  
- Still apply all correction metadata + exclusion flags.  
This flags the trip for later review or manual reprocessing.

These scenarios show how the same core principles (record intent + proper metadata + exclusions) adapt to different situations while protecting long-term model quality.

## Why Not Full Delayed Finalization Yet

The cleaner architecture would be to separate:

- **ended**: the trip is complete for the user
- **finalized**: the trip is safe for learning/grading

That would allow a correction window before the system commits the trip to downstream intelligence. But it adds real complexity:

- new lifecycle state for completed trips
- scheduled or opportunistic finalization rules
- new edge cases for transfer detection and habit rebuilding
- more bookkeeping around when a trip is visible vs trusted

For now, that complexity is likely disproportionate to the need.

## Candidate `CORRECT` Scope

If a correction command is added, the safest v1 is:

- admin-only
- only the most recent completed trip
- one field per message
- explicit deterministic grammar, not freeform AI-first parsing

Recommended command shape:

- `CORRECT ROUTE <value>`
- `CORRECT DIRECTION <value>`
- `CORRECT START <value>`
- `CORRECT END <value>`
- `CORRECT NOTES <value>`

Anything outside that should be rejected with a help message rather than guessed.

## Accuracy and Training Policy

Per-trip prediction grading can still happen immediately and be logged in `predictionStats`.

But aggregate model accuracy like "V3 is correct 75% of the time" should be treated as an on-demand calculation from raw `predictionStats`, not as fragile canonical counters.

Practical rule:

- `predictionStats` is the source of truth
- corrected high-impact trips are excluded from accuracy and training paths until explicitly reprocessed
- any incremental `predictionAccuracy` summaries are convenience telemetry only, not authoritative evaluation

## If Delayed Finalization Is Revisited Later

The likely design would be:

- `END` completes the trip for the user
- the most recent completed trip stays editable for some bounded rule
- downstream learning/grading finalizes later

Possible finalization triggers:

- next trip start
- timeout job
- explicit admin repair/reprocess flow

This remains a future architecture option, not a current implementation commitment.
