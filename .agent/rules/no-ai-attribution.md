description: Never add AI co-author attribution to git commits
---

When creating git commits:
- DO NOT add "Co-Authored-By" trailers for AI assistants
- DO NOT add "Generated with" attributions
- Write clean, professional commit messages without AI attribution
- Commit messages should appear as if written by the human developer only
